              In the given assignment I thoroughly enjoyed working on researching material
              for the blogs. Blog writing was a different type of task for me as I was
              never into the writing of blogs yet I am an avid reader which helped me a
              lot in writing these blogs. I usually love technology and new technological
              inventions that are hitting the market. Technological advancement has always
              been my area of research and so the task was not excessively difficult for
              me rather I was well prepared for the information that I wanted to put into
              the task.
            </p>

            <p>
              The first task of writing a blog on artificial writing was very informative
              as I came to know about a lot of things that are taking place in the world
              right now. One of the things that inspired me a lot is the idea that we are
              already in the time of artificial intelligence and it has entered into our
              lives from all aspects. It is a delight to see that we are living in an age
              in which there is excessive use of technology which is creating convenience
              in our lives. However, we should also be prepared for the drawbacks of these
              technological advancements. As these technological advancements can have
              some detrimental impact on the health and lives of common people.

              One of the challenging tasks in blog writing is that the writer might
              deviate from the main topic of the blog. I made sure that I stick relevant
              to the topic and that my blog is not only informative but also helpful in
              giving knowledge to the users. I also took care of the words as I preferred
              not to use the information without giving proper credit to the sites from
              where the information was being collected.
            </p>

            <p>
              I think overall the experience was different and I am also open to criticism
              that can add more skills to my writing. I believe that being original with
              the thoughts and words so the reader finds the reading material interesting.
              Therefore I did not stick to the collection and writing of the information
              rather I also put some images to make the whole blog more interesting.
            </p>

            <p>
              I believe that my writing has room for improvement yet I have also analyzed
              that with continuous practice I can bring more volume to my ideas and can
              constructively fabricate essays and blogs. Moreover, the exercise of writing
              blogs also broadens my horizon of thinking and I was critical while writing
              my blog. The continuous reasoning in the blog gave me immense knowledge and
              confidence about the topic. I believe that I can contribute well after
              writing these blogs and can successfully replicate my knowledge with
              practical and real-life scenarios. I am happy that I explored my skills in
              writing about technical topics.
            </p>

            <p>
              I believe that constructive feedback can assist me in assertively improving
              my writing and by working on the loopholes I will be able to write blogs
              more effectively leaving some compelling messages for the readers. Any piece
              of feedback will assist me in improving my writing which will be beneficial
              for me in the long run.
